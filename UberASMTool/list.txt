gamemode:
	;Why these under gamemode instead of levels and overworld?
	;it's because levels and overworld code only run when they
	;are fully loaded, this means the meters will abruptly
	;appear and Mario becoming from small to big when the fading
	;ends.
		0C	PlayerHealthNoSmallMario.asm
		0D	DisplayPlayerHealthOverworld.asm ;\Remove these if you are not planning to display HP on the overworld map.

level:
*	HandleHPDrainAndKnockback.asm, RememberHPUpgradePickupState.asm
;^This handles HP going down (rolling effect when enabled) after enemy damages the player, as well as the knockback.
; The second one prevents upgrade blocks from respawning in the level when the player leaves and re-enter the level

overworld:
*	RestoreHealthAfterDeath.asm
		;^This makes sure that on the map, the player cannot have 0HP, and be Small Mario
